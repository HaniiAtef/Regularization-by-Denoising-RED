## Project Overview

### Concept and Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement advanced image denoising techniques, with a focus on the **Regularization by Denoising (RED)** framework. RED leverages sophisticated denoising engines to impose regularization constraints during the image reconstruction process, enhancing the quality of the restored images.

### Algorithms Implemented

- **ADMM (Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers):**  
  An optimization algorithm that decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems, making it easier to handle complex regularization terms.

- **Fixed Point Iteration:**  
  A method that iteratively applies a function to converge to a fixed point, representing the denoised image.

- **Gradient Descent (GD):**  
  An optimization technique that iteratively moves towards the minimum of the objective function by following the negative gradient.

- **Accelerated Gradient Descent (AGD):**  
  An enhanced version of GD that uses momentum to accelerate convergence.

Each of these algorithms is tested with different denoising engines, namely traditional median filters and neural network-based denoisers, to evaluate their effectiveness and performance.

## Results

The project includes comprehensive simulations and evaluations of the implemented algorithms. Key metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used to assess the quality of denoised images. The results demonstrate the superiority of neural network denoisers in achieving higher PSNR values and better visual quality compared to traditional methods.

**Highlights:**

- **Median Filter:** Provides baseline performance with moderate improvements in image quality.
- **Trained Neural Networks:** Achieve significant enhancements in PSNR and visual clarity.
- **Pre-trained Networks:** Offer robust denoising capabilities with faster convergence times.

Detailed results, including convergence curves and visual comparisons, are documented in the project report and are available within the respective Jupyter Notebooks.
